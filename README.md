# GIS_Senior_Project
The goal of this project was to learn about geographic information systems (GIS) and apply that knowledge to analyze the amount of gerrymandering in congressional districts.
The project involved creating a Postgres databse instance on AWS and connecting it with QuantumGIS to create maps and perform analysis.
Because many of the files in this project were large for github, this repository only contains the scripts written.
